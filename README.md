Hey, Python programming seems fun, lets make an linux-shell-emulator with it.

### TODO

- [ ] `ssh`: create new session
- [ ] `cat` x: read a file named x, print error if not exist
- [ ] `cp` x y: copy x as y
- [x] `tree` x: print folder as tree format
- [x] `ls`: list directories and files
- [x] `cd` x: switch to x directory
- [x] `mkdir` x: create a directory named x
- [x] `rmdir` x: remove directory x, files and sub-folders will also be removed
- [x] `touch` x: create a new file
- [x] `rm` x: remove file x
- [x] `exit`: exit the emulator
